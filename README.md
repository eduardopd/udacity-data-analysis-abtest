Udacity - Data Analysis Nanodegree - Project 3: A/B Test

## About this Project

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, an A/B test is conducted to verify if a new e-commerce web page should be implemented or not. 

## Getting Started

### Why? 

An A/B test is important to assure if a new functionality has any practical significance in the user's conversion rate. 

### Files

In the project directory, there are three files. One is the Jupyter notebook where the code is written. The other two files are .csv files where all the data required for the A/B test is in. 

### Running the code

To run this project you should have a local server running with Jupyter Notebook installed (you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

The Jupyter notebook is filled with two types of cells, markdown and, code. To run the cells press shift + return and then check the results if there is any to be shown. 

### Built With 

[Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
